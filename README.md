Title: Santa's Shuffle

A fun webpage where you can let an unreliable random generator choose your imaginary Christmas gifts for indecisive you. Maybe you really wanted a Raspberry Pi but got raspberry pie instead, everyone's been there. The Javascript portion was written with zero experience, if something doesn't make sense, chances are it doesn't. Truly a Christmas miracle project.

Submission for Codédex's 24-hour holiday hackathon. It came at the right time because I had just finished learning HTML and CSS and was going to start learning JavaScript, so it not only helped me practice what I learned, but also forced me to learn JavaScript within 24 hours.

I wanted a game that can be played within a few minutes that wasn't too boring. It has user input because only the player knows what's interesting to them, and it has a random generator to make things.. fun. I'm not the best at design so I went with simple Christmas colors and simple Christmas assets. The pixel art and font were inspired by Codédex's art style (also because I love this art style).

The most time-consuming parts (not in order): 
- Everything JavaScript, especially the random generator and multi-functional button
- Learning how to use `position: absolute` and `position: relative`
- Allow zoom in/out without affecting the layout or functionality much

I've learned so much through this project, like JavaScript and how to google things. The project won a "First Time Hack" award, and achieving this for my 1st hackathon is a huge accomplishment. I also learned I'm capable of many things if I put my mind to it. When I started the project, I had doubts whether I could even finish it, so being able to finish it enough to submit was already an accomplishment. I look forward to my future hackathons, cuz this was an awesome experience and first impression.

Thanks to Codédex for hosting such a well-run hackathon and for being so understanding and responsive.
