Title: Santa's Shuffle

A fun webpage where you can let an unreliable random generator choose your imaginary Christmas gifts for indecisive you. Maybe you really wanted a Raspberry Pi but got raspberry pie instead, everyone's been there, might as well be in it together. The Javascript portion was written with zero experience, if something doesn't make sense, chances are it doesn't. Truly a Christmas miracle project.
